    <h2>The lions</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and savannahs, but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, <br>
         but when persecuted adapts to being active at night and at twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult males,
        <br> related females and cubs. Prides vary in size and composition from three to 20 adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability. <br>
         Females cooperate when hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and even giraffe
